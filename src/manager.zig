//! Idiomatic Zig wrapper around the C FFI exposed by raft-sys
//! (which itself wraps tikv's `raft-rs 0.7` via cbindgen). The
//! wrapper is intentionally thin — it doesn't hide the lifecycle
//! quirks of raft-rs (need to call `tick` periodically to drive
//! timers, then `poll_ready` to discover groups with pending work,
//! then `process_ready` to apply that work via a callback). It
//! does erase the C-ABI noise: bool returns, slices instead of
//! pointer+length pairs, Zig errors instead of int return codes.
//!
//! Apply callbacks remain raw `callconv(.c)` for now — consumers
//! that want a "give me a Zig closure" wrapper can build one on
//! top, but the trampoline pattern adds a hop that we don't pay
//! for unless we need it. The cost matters: `process_ready` fires
//! the callback once per applied entry, on the hot path.
